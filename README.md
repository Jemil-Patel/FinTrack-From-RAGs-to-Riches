#  Fintrack: From RAG to Riches

An intelligent, full-stack web application that transforms dense financial reports into interactive conversational partners. Upload a PDF and ask complex questions to receive instant, context-aware answers generated by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline.

## Key Features

*   **PDF to Chat:** Instantly turn any financial report into a searchable, conversational knowledge base.
*   **Intelligent RAG Engine:** Utilizes a powerful RAG pipeline with LangChain to provide answers grounded in the document's content.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, responsive interface built with Next.js, featuring pre-made prompts, Markdown/table rendering, dark mode, and subtle animations.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** A decoupled, monorepo design with a stateless FastAPI backend and a Next.js frontend, ready for deployment and future growth.

## Technology & Architecture

This project is a decoupled, full-stack application organized in a monorepo.

*   **Frontend (Next.js / Vercel):** A fully interactive UI built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.
*   **Backend (FastAPI / Render):** A stateless Python API that orchestrates the entire RAG pipeline using LangChain.
*   **Data Layer (Supabase):**
    *   **Storage:** Persists the original uploaded PDF files.
    *   **Postgres (`pgvector`):** Serves as the production-grade vector database for embeddings.
*   **AI Model (Hugging Face):** Provides the free-tier inference endpoint for the Large Language Model.

## Getting Started

This repository contains two main packages:
*   `/backend`: The Python FastAPI application.
*   `/frontend`: The Next.js React application.

Detailed setup instructions for Supabase and local development can be found in the respective directories or the project's extended documentation.

**Core Dependencies:**
*   **Backend:** `fastapi`, `langchain`, `supabase-py`, `python-dotenv`
*   **Frontend:** `next`, `react`, `tailwindcss`, `shadcn-ui`, `axios`

## Future Enhancements

The current application is a robust MVP. Future work will focus on:

*   **Streaming Responses:** Stream answers token-by-token for a live, ChatGPT-like experience.
*   **Source Highlighting:** Display the exact source text from the PDF used to generate an answer to build user trust.
*   **User Authentication:** Integrate Supabase Auth for user accounts, saved chat histories, and private document management.
